			<p>A master of martial maneuvers, Swordsage Warriors are a physically adept â€” a blade wizard whose knowledge of the Sublime Way lets her unlock blinding speed and spiritual transcendence. Unlike other monks, the Swordsage trains with his weapon as well as his martial arts, practicing relentless discipline to hone her skills and perfect her combat maneuvers. The Masters of the Sublime way are a blur of deadly strikes on the battlefield, evidence of years of intensive training and meditation.</p>

			<p><em>3rd-Level Feature</em></p>
			<p>Beginning at 3rd level, your training and discipline have taught you to channel your Focus into deadly combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Maneuvers.</b> You learn five maneuvers of your choice from the list of maneuvers available to the Battle Master. You can use only one maneuver per attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Superiority Dice.</b> You have four superiority dice, which are based on your Martial Arts die, and increase in size when they do. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Saving Throws.</b> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: <b>Maneuver save DC</b> = DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.</p>
